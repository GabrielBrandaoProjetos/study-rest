## About this Project

This project was bootstrapped with Create Next App.

The idea the App is:

Timing study and rest time to achieve greater efficiency in study or work.
After each cycle the user is challenged to do an exercise during the rest break. The app has a game format to motivate the user to do the exercises and level up.

### Pomodoro Technique

Is a method of time management developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. 
The technique consists of using a stopwatch to divide the work into 25-minute periods, separated by brief intervals. 
The technique derives its name from the Italian word pomodoro (tomato), as a reference to the popular gastronomic timer in the form of this fruit. 
The method is based on the idea that frequent breaks can increase mental alertness.
